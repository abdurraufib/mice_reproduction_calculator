mice_reproduction_calculator
==================
By Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf <ibrauf@umich.edu>

I was inspired to make this calculator after remembering the time my house got infested with mice and after seeing a duck reproduction calculator in my Introductory Programming and Data Structures course. 

What I learned
---------------
- What a recursive function is
- How to implement a recursive function
